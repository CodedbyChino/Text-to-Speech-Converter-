## Code Style Guidelines

To maintain consistency and readability in the codebase, we follow certain code style guidelines. Please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing code to the Text-to-Speech Converter project:

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines for Python code.
- Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
- Write comments to explain complex logic or algorithms.
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces).
- Limit lines to 79 characters to ensure readability.
- Use meaningful commit messages that describe the purpose of the changes.

We use tools like Flake8 and Pylint to enforce code style consistency. Before submitting a pull request, please run these tools on your code to ensure it meets the project's standards.
